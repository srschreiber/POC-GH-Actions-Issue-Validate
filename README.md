# GitHub VPN

Access all of the things. Securely.

This README assumes the following:

* You're on a Mac ([running Windows?](#running-windows))
* You've setup your machine with github/setup-puppet / Boxen.
* Your GitHub repos are under `~/github` as a result of using Boxen.
* You've received an email back from a fine Opstocat with a path that looks like `jnewland@gold1-ext.rs.github.com:jnewland.github.com.tgz`

## Setup

* Run Boxen

```
boxen vpn
cd ~/github/vpn
```

* Download your keys and extract them into the checkout:

```
scp $USER@gold1-ext.rs.github.com:$USER.github.com.tgz .
tar xzvf $USER.github.com.tgz
make viscosity
```

* If you are upgrading from an older install, just copy the `~/github/vpn/KEYS` directory over and run `make viscosity`.

* Look for a new icon that looks like a globe in your menu bar. This is Viscosity. Click it, and try connecting to each of the VPNs listed.

* Test that the connections are working using these links:

  * [Production](http://aux1.rs.github.com:9292/)

* Register your copy of Viscosity with this info:

```
Name:  GitHub
Email: david@github.com
Key:   VM1V-HWJAOC-46IQGJ-ZAIVX3-6ZJ4Y4-UBNVBY
```

**If this key doesn't work, email david@github.com to order more seats.**

## Updating

Viscosity makes copies of all the configurations files and keys in the
`~/Library/Application Support/Viscosity/OpenVPN` directory. If you're
updating your configuration, you'll need to either edit them via the
app OR quit Viscosity first and then open up the config files and edit them
by hand.

If you want to blow away your current config and setup things from scratch:

    killall Viscosity
    sudo killall openvpn
    make clean
    make viscosity

## Problem?

[Create a new issue](https://github.com/github/vpn/issues/new) and cc @github/ops.
Please include the logs from any failed connections. Someone from the Ops team
will help you as soon as they can!

## Uninstall

    make clean

## Running Windows?

Good for you! Get to the 
[download page](http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html)
on OpenVPN.net and get the latest Windows installer
(probably the 64bit version).

### Configure

 * Download the Viscosity configuration files you want from this repository.
 * Change their file extension to ```.ovpn``` and move them inside the 
   OpenVPN config directory (\Program Files\OpenVPN\Config). 
 * Unpack the tar.gz file you got from the ops team ([7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/))
   into the same directory.
 * Rename the three files to ca.crt, key.key and cert.crt (or change the 
   corresponding config options to point to their proper locations)

### Run
 * Start OpenVPN GUI **in administrator mode**. 
 * Right click on the OpenVPN icon in the tray and you should see either a connect 
   menu entry (if you only installed one config) or submenus for each config.

#### Out of TAP devices?
OpenVPN will only add one TAP device initially. You need one TAP for each 
_concurrent_ VPN connection. If you need more there's a start menu entry 
called "Add a new TAP virtual ethernet adapter".
